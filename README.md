# Generative AI On AWS

# GenAI Project with Llama 3B LLM Model

This project utilizes AWS Bedrock and AWS Lambda architecture to create a Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) application powered by the Llama 3B Large Language Model (LLM).

## Overview

The GenAI project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of AI in generating human-like text content. Leveraging AWS Bedrock and AWS Lambda architecture provides a scalable and reliable infrastructure for deploying and managing AI models. The Llama 3B LLM model, known for its advanced natural language processing capabilities, serves as the backbone for generating text content.

## Features

- **AWS Bedrock Lambda Architecture:** Utilizes AWS infrastructure for scalable and reliable deployment.
- **Llama 3B LLM Model:** Employs the Llama 3B model for generating text content.
- **Text Generation:** Generates human-like text based on input prompts.
- **Scalable Deployment:** Easily deployable and scalable to accommodate varying workloads.
